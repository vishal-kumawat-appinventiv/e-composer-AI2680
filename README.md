}
```

### 2.3 TypeScript (TS)

- TypeScript provides a way to catch errors early and improve code quality at compile time.
- Industry standard of TypeScript is used for the project.

```
{
  "typescript": "^5.5.3",
  "typescript-eslint": "^8.0.1",
}
```

### 2.4 Error Boundary (React Error Boundary)

- Error Boundary is a React component that catches errors in its child components and renders a fallback UI.
- It provides a way to handle errors gracefully and prevent them from crashing the entire application.
- Individual components are wrapped with the Error Boundary component to handle errors gracefully.

```
{
  "react-error-boundary": "^4.0.13",
}
```

### 2.5 React Router

- React Router is a popular library for handling routing in React applications.
- It provides a way to define routes and navigate between them, making it easy to create complex navigation structures.

## 3. Approaches Used while Development

### 3.1 Context API

- Context API is a feature in React that allows you to share data between components without passing props down the tree.
- Not used Redux or any other state management library because the data is static and not dynamic.
- For synonymous data handling, Context API is a good choice , and also a inbuild feature in React.
- Used in Blog Listing Page and Contact Us Page.
- Blog Listing Page - Fetching the data from BlogContext and rendering the component.
- Contact Us Page - Fetching the data from ContactContext and rendering the component.

### 3.2 Custom Hooks

- Custom Hooks are functions that let you reuse stateful logic between components.
- Used in Blog Listing Page.
- Blog Listing Page - Fetching the data from useFetchBlogData hook and rendering the component.
- useFetchBlogData hook - Filters the data based on the display and banner type.
- useAnnimation hook - triggers the animation on the component.
- useFetchBlogData , useAnnimation hook - Fetching the data from the API and rendering the component.

### 3.3 Routes HOC (Higher Order Component)

- Routes HOC is a higher-order component that allows you to define routes and navigate between them.
- Used in Blog Listing Page and Contact Us Page.
- Two types - Public HOC and Private HOC.
- Public HOC - Checks if the user is logged in and on the auth route, redirects to home, else renders children.
- Private HOC - Checks if the user is logged in and on the auth route, renders children, else redirects to login.
- Assumes that user is logged in ( isUser = true ).

### 3.5 Memorization Techniques

- Memorization Techniques are techniques used to improve the performance of a system by reducing the number of operations required to perform a task.
- useMemo is used in useFetchBlogData hook to memoize the data to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- React.Memo is used in some components which are only dependent on props to memoize the data to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 3.6 Clean Code + Best Practices

- Clean Code is a set of principles and guidelines for writing clean and maintainable code.
- Code is break down into small functions and components for maintainability and reusability.
- Camel Case Naming Convention - Used for variable, function.
- Capital Letters for mock data variables.
- Pascal Case Naming Convention - Used for type, interface.
- Comment is also added to eash function and component for better understanding.
